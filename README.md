## .onion crawler
Run the script with `python onion_crawler onionurlyouwantcrawled.onion`
Use -r to re-crawl the previous valid urls, and -d for previous dead urls.
Must have Tor Browser open while doing this, or if you are using the service, change lines 36-37 to `9050`

Will only crawl urls that contain .onion
